# gatsby-typescript-starter
A fork of @haysclark 's Typescript version of the default Gatsby starter, modified to use [`awesome-typescript-loader`](https://github.com/s-panferov/awesome-typescript-loader) to provide true Typescript compilation and type checking at build time.

For an overview of the project structure please refer to the [Gatsby documentation - Building with Components](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/building-with-components/)

Install this starter (assuming Gatsby is installed) by running from your CLI:
```
gatsby new gatsby-typescrip-startert https://github.com/teoboley/gatsby-typescript-starter
```
